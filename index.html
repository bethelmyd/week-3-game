						<strong>Hi!</strong> I'm David and I'm happy to have you visit my site.<br>
						This isn't my first site but it surely is the first in a very long time.<br>
						I've been too busy to build one until now because I have been busy teaching and working on completing a PhD in Computer Science since forever.<br>
						I finally got it though. But then I couldn't figure out what to do with all that spare time so I decided to focus on Web development. (This is sooooo far removed from my doctoral work it isn't funny.)<br>
						What's hilarious about the entire thing is that I teach Web development, among a host of other things, at Bethune-Cookman University. However, I spend so much time helping my students develop their own sites (and grading homework and setting exams and preparing for classes and ...) that I don't normally have the time to focus on mine.
					</p>
					<p>
						I've also decided that, after many, many years of academia, I'd like a change in environment and career.<br>
						So I started to think along which lines I would like to go and I figured 'Full Stack Web Development'. (Amazing how a PhD mind works!)<br>
						As I mentioned previously, I teach Web development. It so happens that I teach the full stack: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, Bootstrap, PHP, mySQL, and MongoDB (although not as much as the others). So I'm pretty familiar with these elements of full stack development.
						However, I'm no expert and that's why I want to change.<br>
						I like development, especially the programming aspect of it. But teaching usually restricts you to what you can deliver to your audience and that may mean only getting so far into the topic. So I need to get out of academia and into industry where I can concentrate on knowing as much as possible to get the job done and keep getting better at the job.
					</p>
					<p>
						So what would I bring to the table?
						<ol>
							<li>I'm a pretty good programmer.</li>
							<li>I'm detail-oriented so I'm good at finding errors.</li>
							<li>I don't like to cry 'Uncle!' so I'll stick with a problem until it's solved or I die. (Just kidding about the dying part? Maybe.)</li>
							<li>I like a challenge.</li>
							<li>I play well with others even if I don't like them but my disliking people is rare.</li>
							<li>I don't know everything so I'll keep learning.</li>
							<li>I ALWAYS give 150%. I don't like to do things half-way. (This sometimes is a problem when something is due and I'm not too happy with it.)</li>
							<li>I won't tell you that I can do something when I can't. I will tell you that I can try but I won't BS you.</li>
						</ol>
					</p>
					<p>
						Well, I've gone on long enough and you've probably gotten the picture by now anyway.<br>
						If you want to get in touch with me, you can use one of the links on the right or call me at 386-503-5364.
